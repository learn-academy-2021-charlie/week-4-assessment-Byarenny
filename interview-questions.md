# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable in ruby is assigned to an object and can hold information that can be passed and redefined. It is different from other variables because it is assigned to a object. For example, if we have a class named Car we can give it instance variables such as model, year, speed, etc. These variables can be reassigned different values for different cars.

  Researched answer: An instance variable stores data in an object and starts with an @ symbol. In react, we use 'this'.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block in ruby is an method that performs logic. The logic is contained in the def/end keywords.

  Researched answer: Blocks in ruby are anonymous functions and can be created with curly braces{} in addtion to the DO/end keywords. Blocks are passed into a method, it is not the method itself.  



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return means that the method does not need the keyword 'return' to return a value. 

  Researched answer: A methods value is automatically returned without using the keyword 'return'.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is made of only objects and its key:value's like Ruby and functional programming is made of multiple functions like Javascript.

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming focuses on building a whole program from smaller 'containers' of data. This allows us to make changes and adjustments to a certain 'container' of data without affecting the rest of the program. Functional programming focuses on mathematical functions to make a program.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is the blueprint for an object. A class can hold multiple objects and its key:value pairs. We can have a class named "Dog" and within it we can find objects that hold key:value pairs such as "breed:pitbull, weight:30lbs, color:grey" that make up the class "Dog". The values can change.

  Researched answer: A class is the template for the objects. Objects are an instance of a class and have properties that hold values. A class can only be declared once while an object can be created many times and can be reassigned a new value.



6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: attr_accessor is a method that does the setting and getting all in one, within a class. When using attr_accessor, there is no need to make individual setting and getting methods.

  Researched answer: attr_accessor is a short cut method to access and modify data.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. PostgreSQL: also called Postgres, is a Structured Query Language. It is a domain-specific language and an open sourse object-relational database management system.
 
2. Ruby on Rails: server-side web application framework written in ruby

3. CRUD: an acronym describing the minimal actions necessary for a full stack web application

4. ORM: object-relational mapping. A programming technique for converting data between incompatible systems using object-oriented programming languages.

5. Active Record: a rails ORM. Active record takes data stored in a database table and lets you interact with the data like a Ruby object.
